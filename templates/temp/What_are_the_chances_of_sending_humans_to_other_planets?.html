<h4>Rank Data: </h4><br/><div style="width:100%;height:500px;line-height:3em;overflow:scroll;padding:5px;background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#B0A2AA;scrollbar-base-color:#EFEFEF;"><p>No known planet except Earth can be colonized by a human civilization. There are at least three serious issues: temperatures at around 300K, an atmosphere of appropirate pressure, and damaging cosmic radiation (low gravity is also a worry for long-term human presence). Minerals are less of a problem (and water can be synthesized). Mars and the Moon are close enough to the Sun for pressurized greenhouses to provide an environment where humans could stay without space suit. However, the problem of cosmic radiation remains and such "biospheres" must forever dependent on supportive technology. Venus's inhospitable atmosphere makes it completely unfeasible. </p><br><br><p>Using robots to mine planets and moons in the Solar system is certainly a realistic and interesting option. Sending humans there is very expensive and not necessarily sensible. Moreover, it is not clear whether humanity should send any live (including microorganisms) to such places, as this would inevitably forever change their nature (like sending rabbits/cats to Australia); all ongoing space missions are sterilized before being sent on their way.</p><br></div><br/><h4>My Confidence Level is:</h4><div type="confidence-meter" id="confidence-meter" class = "confidence-meter" style="background-color: hsl(59, 75%, 48%)">59</div><br/><h4>Retrieve Data: </h4><div style="width:100%;height:500px;line-height:3em;overflow:scroll;padding:5px;background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#B0A2AA;scrollbar-base-color:#EFEFEF;"><p>Nasa are sending humans to mars because it has a background of evolution very similar to earth, meaning we can discover more about the past and future of our planet. Mars had the capability to have life in the past, and if we can work this out we can answer the fundamental question: Does life exist anywhere else?</p><br><br><p>Now, about humans leaving earth. Humanity will have to leave earth at some point - due to issues like overpopulation, resource shortages and NASA as well as many other scientists are planning things like human missions to asteroids, and eventually developing technology for a human mission into deep space. Astronauts on the ISS are helping us understand how the body changes in space (for example, fluids inside your body aren't pulled down by gravity). Furthermore, these astronauts are helping us prove the technologies needed for exploration into deep space. I found a site about stephen hawking talking about how we need to leave earth <a href="http://www.space.com/8924-stephen-hawking-humanity-won-survive-leaving-earth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.space.com/8924-stephen-hawking-humanity-won-survive-leaving-earth.html</a>. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/20/hawking_alert_leave_planet_earth_stupid_humans/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/20/hawking_alert_leave_planet_earth_stupid_humans/</a></p><br><br><p>However, another thing about the matter of exploration further into space, and why we haven't encountered aliens is that some scientists believe that there a many, many, many sentient civilisations out there, but they wipe themselves out so quickly they never cross paths.</p><br><br><p>Furthermore, there are so many things we need to think about if we will travel and colonise other planets. Like how the planet's gravity will most likely be different, the atmosphere will be at a different density. This is why we need to expand our presence in the solar system, and one day send a long term manned mission to mars.</p><br></div>
