If no action is taken, Earth's orbit is still likely to change, but how much and in which direction is hard to say.</p><br><br><p>Long before the sun goes red giant it will get too hot for the Earth.  If the earth doesn't move, the sun's increased temperature will likely make the earth uncomfortable in a few hundred million years and perhaps scorching in as little as a billion years.   Warmer air and more water vapor in the air will trap heat and at a certain point, yod get a run-away green house effect, long before the red-giant phase.    Short term, changes in CO2 in the atmosphere might slow that.   We could see ice ages before we see run-away heating, but over time, with no human action, run-away heating is likely inevitable - on a very large timescale, like a billion years or so.   Longer if the Earth drifts farther from the sun.</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>what will the last few decades of Earth's life be like? Will the<br>  planet be heated to the point where its surface is like Mercury's<br>  sun-side? Will the sun's output drop low enough that it instead cools,<br>  like Mars? Will the sun expand and engulf the planet, or will the<br>  planet continue to orbit an expanded sun as a lifeless ball?</p><br>  <br>  <p>Will the sun's expansion be gradual or rapid? How will this expansion<br>  affect the rocky planets nearest to it?</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>I'm going to answer the 2nd part first.   The sun's expansion will first be gradual, but the red giant stage will be fairly rapid.   Over the next 4 billion years or so, the sun will get some 60% more luminous, so significantly much more heat at the same orbit.   A very rough rule of thumb is 10% more luminous every billion years. (that's not for every star, just for 1 solar mass) - and that's a pretty ballpark estimate.</p><br><br><p>But just 10% more heat from the sun would raise the Earth's temperature uncomfortably, and with the added water vapor in the air and greenhouse effect, the earth might be a permanent steam room, even at the poles, at just 10% more heat from the sun.</p><br><br><p>asking about the last few decades is the wrong time frame as changes would probably happen much more slowly, though atmospheric/feedback mechanisms in the climate might make changes happen more quickly - ice age speed for example, a few thousand years or so.   Also, as Antarctica drifts away from the south pole, we might see an end to ice ages - there's lots of moving parts to long term climate predictions, but in general, yod see gradual heating to the point where complex life might have a hard time adapting.  </p><br><br><p>The suns output won't drop until after it goes red giant, it's on a steady but gradual increase, followed by a relatively fast increase at the red giant stage.</p><br><br><p>Now, if we terraform Titan, that might be a safe distance to watch the sun go red giant from and it would probably be quite a spectacular show, well, over enough time.</p><br><br><p>As to how fast it will go red-giant, fast for a star means, about 200 million years, so, from the perspective of a human lifetime, watching a star go red giant would be like watching grass grow.</p><br><br><p>A much more intelligent discussion on that than I can give, here:   <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/25622/how-fast-will-the-sun-become-a-red-giant">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/25622/how-fast-will-the-sun-become-a-red-giant</a></p><br></div><h4>Retrieve Data: </h4><div style="width:100%;height:250px;line-height:3em;overflow:scroll;padding:5px;background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#B0A2AA;scrollbar-base-color:#EFEFEF;"><p>This is a fairly loaded question in that it depends heavily on what a "hot Jupiter" actually is defined to be. What is "hot"? What is a "Jupiter"? In reality, there's a continuum of planetary masses and distances from their parent star, and in the literature yoll commonly see references to "hot Neptunes", "hot Saturns," etc.</p><br><br><p>The predominant theory as to how giant planets form is that they first coalesce from rock and ice beyond the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_%28astrophysics%29">ice line</a>, the distance from the parent star at which water becomes solid. This distance is approximately where Mars lies today in our solar system. What's surprising about "hot gas planets" is that they are found <em>within</em> this ice line, significantly within. This implies that after they formed their cores, they migrated closer to their host stars via some currently undetermined process (for which there are several good candidates, but for now let's assume that the existence of hot planets shows that at least one of these processes operates quite regularly).</p><br><br><p>And what about the word "hot"? Well, for the planets that are closest to their parent stars, there is known to be a <a href="http://oklo.org/2010/07/31/radius-anomalies-2/">radius anomaly</a>: The radii of these planets are significantly larger than models of giant planet structure irradiated by their host stars would predict. So I would define "hot" planets as gas giants whose radii are larger than what would be predicted by the standard models.</p><br><br><p>Now that we got some of the definitions out of the way, there's the question of survival. When giant planets are close to their parent stars, they become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a>. As a consequence, there is very little energy tidally dissipated on the surface of the giant planet, the shape of the planet is fixed and there are little internal motions. However, the giant planet <em>also</em> raises a tide on its host star as well, and because it takes a lot of angular momentum to change the spin of an object with 1,000 times more mass, the host stars are almost never going to be tidally locked to their closest planet.</p><br><br><p>The rate at which energy is dissipated within the star is highly uncertain, and this uncertainty is typically swept into a fudge parameter "Q," the quality factor, with lower quality factors reflecting more dissipation. "Q" is measured for certain bodies in our own solar system (i.e. Earth and Jupiter) and in some stellar binaries, but is highly variable from body to body, ranging from about 10 for the Earth to 10^8 for some stars.</p><br><br><p>Whether a planet survives to be observed today depends on how long the orbital decay time, which is determined by Q, compares to the age of the system. For some systems, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASP-12b">WASP-12b</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASP-19b">WASP-19b</a>, which feature highly inflated hot Jupiters, Q is estimated to be small enough to cause them to fall into their host stars in a surprisingly short time (&lt; 10^7 years).</p><br><br><p>One other possibility is that the gas surrounding the rock/ice core is blasted away by the tremendous amount of heat deposited into the planet. This leaves you with a relatively low-density planet that's somewhat devoid of iron, as the cores of giant planets form further from their host stars than the rocky planets. There are a few candidate close-in, Neptune-mass objects that may have been produced as a result of them losing the bulk of their atmospheres in this way (Example: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6555">GJ3470b</a>).</p><br><br><p>As for our own solar system, the formation of a hot Jupiter would have likely destroyed the inner solar system as it migrated close to the Sun, owing to the fact that it would violently perturb the inner planets' orbits. Additionally, the Sun would likely be enhanced in metals owing to the accretion of metal-rich material from this giant planet. While it's potentially possible that there was a hot Jupiter in our solar system before the other planets formed, it currently seems unlikely.</p><br></div>
