Even advanced laboratories have difficulty making the determination <em>for certain</em>.</p><br><br><p>This is also a complex problem that gets more difficult as various standards are used and then fail.  Before 2000, a common solution was to simply use microscopic analysis to look for pollen and and other vegetable matter.  Since then, many honey processing plants have been developing increasingly advanced filtering techniques that will remove the characteristic markers (deliberately or unintentionally).  <strong>[**See detailed note below.]</strong>  Various chemical or basic physical markers also have proved insufficient, since the sugar composition of honey can be faked quite well with various sugar syrup blends.</p><br><br><p>The accepted standard these days, as mentioned in the question, seems to be to use a mass spectrometer to determine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope-ratio_mass_spectrometry" rel="nofollow">carbon-13 to carbon-12 isotope ratio</a> in a rather specific lab procedure.  (Obviously most people don't have a mass spectrometer at home.)  The current procedure for this test was adopted after previous lab tests were shown to <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8935122/False-positives-in-manuka-honey-tests" rel="nofollow">generate false positives</a> in some batches of honey.  The isotope ratio method is the only one specifically listed in the FDA's <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_108.html" rel="nofollow">import alert</a> to determine the possibility of adulteration:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>FDA laboratories do not have the instrumental capability to analyze<br>  honey according to the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC<br>  International, AOAC Official Method 991.41, <strong>which requires an isotope<br>  ratio mass spectrometer.</strong></p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>Ironically, in order to avoid the previous false positives for the New Zealand honey mentioned above, the new testing process <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20635333" rel="nofollow">needs to have the pollen completely removed</a>, a process which has also been used to hide the origin of honey and to confuse analysis:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>To eliminate a false positive C(4) sugar test for Manuka honey, prior<br>  removal of pollen and other insoluble material from the honey is<br>  necessary to ensure that only the pure protein is isolated.</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>But even a refined isotopic methodology is flawed when it comes to detecting various types of adulteration, specifically beet sugar.  As <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814612018006" rel="nofollow">this article</a> notes:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>[Using isotope ratios from a mass spectrometer,] adulteration using C4<br>  sugar syrups (HFCS and GS) could be detected to a certain extent while<br>  <strong>adulteration of honey using C3 sugar syrups (beet sugar) could not be<br>  detected.</strong> Adulteration by using SS (beet sugar) still has a serious<br>  detection problem, especially in countries in which beet is used in<br>  manufacturing sugar.</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>So, what's the alternative?  Well, the other general method that could detect various adulterating components is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry" rel="nofollow">differential scanning calorimetry</a> (DSC).  <a href="http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/augustseptember-2009/advances-in-honey-adulteration-detection/" rel="nofollow">This article</a> gives a good summary of the process, which essentially looks at how a material behaves as it undergoes thermal changes.  At certain temperatures when crystallization or something occurs, there will be excess heat absorbed or given off compared to at other temperatures.  And at other points there will be minor changes in heat capacity (i.e., the amount of heat it takes to alter the temperature of a substance by a specific number of degrees).</p><br><br><p>Honey, for example, displays a glass transition temperature (Tg) around -40°C (-40°F) near a certain point in crystallization.  Other sugar syrups may not show this, but they may show changes at slightly higher temperatures (still below freezing), due to water crystals freezing or thawing.  (Water is included in the sugar network in honey, so it doesn't show the same characteristics.)</p><br><br><p>There are other thermal properties that can be measured at various temperatures.  As <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11754568" rel="nofollow">this article</a> summarizes in its conclusion:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>Used concomitantly with the second enthalpy of fusion (occurring<br>  between 40 and 90°C), the glass transition temperature, Tg, is one of<br>  the most potentially useful parameters for characterizing honeys and<br>  syrups and for distinguishing between them. The Tg value, being<br>  strongly dependent on the amorphous phases of the sample, will respond<br>  to modification of the chemical composition and the implicit<br>  structural modification caused by the addition of exogenous material.<br>  Thus, adulteration of the honey will cause inevitable changes in both<br>  Tg and [delta]H2 values. <strong>Under laboratory conditions, adulterations by<br>  industrial sugar syrups can be detected from 5-10% additions depending<br>  on the measured parameter.</strong></p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>I would pay particular attention to this final sentence -- the differences can only be detected "under laboratory conditions" where precise temperatures and amounts of heat can be measured.  To replicate such a test at home, yod need to be able to add a certain precise amount of heat to the honey at subzero temperatures, all the while keeping it isolated from other sources of temperature fluctuations and observing where the heating "stalls" briefly.  Then, yod have to calibrate your homemade test against some known samples (syrups, 100% honey, etc.) just to be sure yore actually observing the same things as in the article cited here.  Yod need to confirm that by observing a more subtle difference in heat capacity changes that would occur in hot temperature ranges (below boiling).</p><br><br><p>Even under lab conditions, this sort of testing has a threshold of 5-10% adulteration, and that requires something like being able to detect the difference between a glass transition onset at -41°C vs. -42°C.  Also, it should be noted that these physical characteristics are inconsistent among various batches of honey.  In <a href="http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kfn/E1FSA3/2010/v15n4/E1FSA3_2010_v15n4_356.pdf" rel="nofollow">this study</a>, for example, the Tg was found to have a variance of over 7°C in different pure honey samples.  In the study quoted above, that range of 7°C would indicate a difference between pure honey and a 50/50 mixture with a sugar solution.  (If you look around at other studies, like <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Sbirrazzuoli/publication/228502087_Application_of_DSC_as_a_tool_for_honey_floral_species_characterization_and_adulteration_detection/links/09e415075a6cfcb24c000000.pdf" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10794630" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, you begin to see a Tg range that is well over 15°C for various pure honey types.) </p><br><br><p>I'd guess this is partly the reason why DSC isn't generally adopted as an official testing procedure: <em>to use it effectively, yod need to really know the specific kind of honey you started with before blending with adulterants, and most of the time you don't.</em></p><br><br><p>Bottom line: there's just no way to do a test like this at home.</p><br><br><p>Finally, to address a point raised in the question, based on the DSC data there should be minor differences in honey's behavior at various temperatures, perhaps even how fast it dissolves at a certain temperature.  But the differences are so small and/or inconsistent among different types of honey or different types of adulterating components that there's no practical way of consistently identifying them outside of a lab environment where very precise conditions and measurements are possible.  It <em>might</em> be possible to isolate adulterated samples outside of a lab given prior knowledge of the original honey used and the specific adulterants that might be present, but that information is generally not available.  If it were a simple matter of a test like "let's mix this honey in some water and measure how long it takes to dissolve," government regulations would not be resorting to mass spectrometers to try to detect adulteration.</p><br><br><hr><br><br><p>Note that this answer really only "scratches the surface" of the various testing methods available.  <a href="http://www.honey.com/testing-labs/adulteration-test-descriptions" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a partial list of possible tests.  Even a cursory search will uncover hundreds of scientific articles describing the advantages and limitations of various tests.  Note that most of the other tests only detect specific kinds of adulteration and/or are mostly used as initial screening tests that then need to be verified by another lab procedure.  As mentioned, the current standard seems to be an isotope ratio test.</p><br><br><hr><br><br><p>** <strong>ADDED CLARIFICATION ON POLLEN AND FILTRATION:</strong> Some pollen is generally removed in the normal filtration process used to produce a "clear" honey that doesn't crystallize quickly during storage. However, traditional filtration techniques often allow trace amounts of pollen to remain, while some processes may use a more complex "ultrafiltration" method that will remove all pollen traces.  The reason for <em>complete</em> pollen filtration may have originated with a desire <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/tests-show-most-store-honey-isnt-honey/#.VUy2wMu350w" rel="nofollow">to disguise the geographic origin of honey</a>, whether pure or adulterated.  In 2001, for example, the U.S. instituted high tariffs on Chinese honey, to avoid putting American beekeepers out of business.  At other times, various countries have instituted outright bans on honey for periods due to contamination or adulteration, such as the <a href="http://beekeepingtimes.com/index.php/news-&amp;-events/the-honey-trade/56/432-european-commission-lifts-ban-on-import-of-indian-honey" rel="nofollow">EU ban of Indian honey</a> in 2011-12.  Such actions have provided strong incentives for Asian honey producers to disguise the origin of honey, even if it is unadulterated.  The result is that large amounts of commercially available honey are now filtered to remove all pollen, which has a side effect of making adulteration detection much more complex.  That said, it should be noted that normal filtration may also result in very low or undetectable amounts of pollen, so <strong>the absence of pollen is not necessarily evidence that any deception is intended.</strong>  (See further details and explanation <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/11/25/142659547/relax-folks-it-really-is-honey-after-all" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)  However, processing methods that deliberately remove all pollen have been used by those who wish to disguise origin and/or adulterate honey with cheaper substitutes.  The question specifically inquired about Asian honeys which had been diluted with water; given that ultrafiltration often involves adding water during processing and has apparently been used by some Asian producers, I originally wrote my answer to target the specific honey type inquired about.  Once again: an undetectable level of pollen in other countries and from other producers is NOT necessarily evidence of anything nefarious.</p><br></div><h4>Retrieve Data: </h4><div style="width:100%;height:250px;line-height:3em;overflow:scroll;padding:5px;background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#B0A2AA;scrollbar-base-color:#EFEFEF;"><p>Instead of endless comment discussions, I decided to post an answer. </p><br><br><p>First of all, I totally agree with Jefromi. Nobody in the world knows how to produce <em>durable</em> non-stick pans (if we form our expectations of durability similar to expectations of regular pans, so several years or a few decades). If you invest into the most expensive non-stick pan in the world, it will still lose its non-stickiness after some time. The non-stick surface is like a bar of soap, it gets destroyed with use. </p><br><br><p>But this doesn't mean that buying the cheapest pans is the best decision, because the cheapest pans 1) have other flaws besides lack of durability, and 2) can wear out quicker. </p><br><br><p>What is the relation between pan quality and price? I took a look at test results from Stiftung Warentest, a very thorough consumer research organisation in Germany. It is independent of all manufacturers and has strict quality control of its measuring methods. I looked at results from three tests: a <a href="http://www.test.de/Beschichtete-Pfannen-Die-Beste-kostet-80-Euro-1230094-2230094/" rel="nofollow">non-stick pan test from 2007</a>, a <a href="http://www.test.de/Beschichtete-Pfannen-Gute-Pfannen-fuer-wenig-Geld-1609421-0/" rel="nofollow">"budget" non-stick pan test from 2004</a>, and a <a href="http://www.test.de/Pfannen-Frohe-Kunde-fuer-Koeche-4186853-0/" rel="nofollow">PTFE- and ceramic pan test from 2011</a>. (The tests are in German. To see a table with numeric results, click at the "Testergebnisse: Pfannen" tab in the left-side menu of each article. The first numeric column, Qualitaetsurteil, is a weighted score calculated from the numbers in the columns to the right. The numbers are in the German school grade system, 1.0 for best and 5.0 for worst. All brands are widely available in Germany and may not be available internationally. I didn't bother to account for inflation in the following conclusions.) </p><br><br><p>What the first test shows: There is not a strong correlation between price and quality within the mid-price segment. Most pans are in the 30-80 Euro range, and most of them get a grade between 2.0 and 3.0. </p><br><br><p>Strangely, the second test also has pans up to 119 Euro, despite its title promising budget pans. But it includes more cheap pans than the first test. Again, we see that there is not much correlation between price and grade. Also, not all pans have the same strengths: for example the Ikea pan has a great score at non-stickiness, but it is mediocre in frying result quality, and its handle gets too hot. The 119 Euro pan gets a rather bad grade, but the best four pans are expensive, in the 68-99 Euro range. </p><br><br><p>The third test is hard to interpret. They compared ceramic and PTFE in the same test and pronounced ceramic the clear winner. 2011, ceramic pans were way too new on the market, so they probably didn't know about their weakness: the ceramic fails after a few months of use, much more spectacular than PTFE, without a correlation to mechanical damage (unlike PTFE). So they used a testing procedure geared at mechanical damage to calculate the test score (they filled the pan with ball bearings and moved it, and also used sandpaper on it). On the main page of the article, as well as on the Amazon reivews of these pans, there are multiple people saying that the non-stick fails quite early. </p><br><br><p>Beside this methodological fault, we can see that there isn't all that much difference between the pans measured. The best gets a 2.0 and there is only one below 2.5. </p><br><br><p>An America's test kitchen test which Jefromi linked in the comments also evaluated pans. The results are behind a paywall, but the methodology is free to read. They say that they tested durability by repeatedly frying an egg, until the egg started sticking. Most of them failed after 30 to 40 eggs, a single one kept going after 76, but there were ones which failed almost immediately. Luckily, you don't have to throw out the pan the first time an egg sticks, but this confirms that, beside a few outliers, nonstick pans have a very similar lifetime. </p><br><br><p>My advice is to go to a physical store and buy a nice heavy-bottomed pan, without splurging on the most expensive ones. Choose one which feels heavy enough to give you a good heat distribution and has visibly good production quality. It will probably last a couple of years. The actual life can vary a lot depending on how frequently you fry and how good you are at controlling temperature and treating it gently (no dishwasher!). It is personal preference how much you are willing to spend for this kind of lifetime. </p><br></div>
